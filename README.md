Happy modding!

## Guide:
1. Name the card, choose a location to save the card, for it to work, the card must be within the "Cards" folder. (Should already be at location once the create card button is pressed)
Using the name of an existing card will load that card's content(edit mode)
2. Card type: choose the type of the card.
3. Action list, browse categories for actions
4. Once actions are added to the action table, fill out the action value and choose options presented in the table as you see fit.(select actions in table and press remove if want to remove)
5. Want to add/remove action on upgrade? Tick the box otherwise skip to step 7
6. Select from the action list, fill out value as usual, choose to whether add or remove
7. Fill out cost, choose card's rarity and target.
8. Write a description for the card, refer to the keycodes section for dynamic numbers.
9. Want a different description upon upgrade? select the box and repeat step 8
10. Card states: default is when the card is not upgraded. If the box for each item is selected, that state will appear on the version of the card that was selected.
11. Seen is just for the card to be unlocked in the library so you can see it. 
12. Create card! wooo
13. Press new card for new card, obviously.
